# Hadean 4.6~4 Ga
- Radiometric dating = Ur-Pb = 4.56 ± 0.01 Ga
- Earth formed from original solar nebula material
- Moon = 1/18 of Earth mass
- Largest collision = drive off atmosphere and ocean entire → Create the magma ocean
- Moon formed (4.5 Ga) after the core and mantle differentiated
- Mainly H, CH4, NH3 and WV
- H lost = secondary atmosphere
- Gravity + Swapped away by solar wind
- Massive collisions to obtain the C, N and S mix today

# Hadean 4~3.3 Ga
Earth cooled + Crust formed 
Outgassing by volcanic eruptions
Mainly CH4, NH3, CO2, CO, N2 and HCl
Banded iron formation = formed in reducing environment
20~40% Si and 40~60% Fe mostly formed 3.8 Ga ago (Algoma type)
Account for 60% of the world iron reserve!
Have not formed since = Precambrian = unique chemistry
First prokaryotic life at 3.77 Ga (Origin of life?)
